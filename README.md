# Address Model Training

This repository contains the source files for [KurrawongAI](https://kurrawong.ai)'s online, interactive, training for the [ICSM ANZ Address Model](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr).

Also included is use of related models:

* [Geographical Names Model](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/gn)
* [Roads Naming Model](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/roads)
* [Cadastral Model](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/cad)
* [Cadastral Survey Data Model](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/csdm)

This training was originally created for [NSW Spatial Services](https://www.spatial.nsw.gov.au/) in Febrary, 2026 but is available for wider use.

The source materials developed here are available free of charge. If you wish for them to be delivered as in-person or online training, please [contact KurrawongAI](#contact).

## Contents

The training in this repositories' course is presented in 4 modules which aim to be presented in 4, 2-hour sessions:

1. **Module 1**: Introduction, Overview & Concepts
2. **Module 2**: Implementations
3. **Module 3**: Use & Maintenance
4. **Module 4**: Practice

The Jupyter Notebook files for each, `module-1.ipybn` etc. outline their content.

## More about the online resources

This training uses [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) which are programming script files that contain both executable code and documentation. In this case the executable code is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the documentation is written in the simple [Markdown](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) format. These notebooks allow you to read about a scenario, execute provided code for it, see the results from execution - print-outs but also errors etc. - and even alter the executable code to try out new things, all within the system. Usually people who are just using Notebooks, instead of developing them, view them in web browsers that render the notebooks online for them and execute the code on a server, allowing them to not have to install anything, but they can also be run locally using a coding tool like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

### More ways to run

Perhaps you'd like to run these training modules locally, i.e. on your computer, within a programming environment, so you can experiment with them?

If so, you will need to:

1. clone this repository down to your local computer
   * If this is new to you, see this documentation: [GitHub's Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. access it via a desktop programming tool 
    * there are many tools you could choose for this that support Jupyter Notebooks, like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [PyCharm Professional](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). Check out this list <https://blog.reviewnb.com/choosing-the-right-ide/>
    * each of those tools has plenty of resources to get you started. For PyCharm, see this video on YouTube: [How To Run Jupyter Notebook In PyCharm?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ft8Iwegc4E)

Once you have it cloned, and you are accessing it in your programming environment, you can run it can change anything you like!
